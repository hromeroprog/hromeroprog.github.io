# Hugo Romero's Personal Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal website! Designed with simplicity in mind, my website is a single-page layout that showcases my projects, presents my curriculum in an interactive manner, and provides contact links for reaching out.

## Features

1. **Projects** : A compilation of my most impactful and intriguing projects. Each project is presented with concise details, snapshots, and links to the repository or live demonstration (wherever applicable).
2. **Interactive Curriculum** : Instead of the traditional resume, I've chosen to present my professional journey in an interactive format, allowing you to engage and delve deep into the milestones and achievements that have shaped my career.
3. **Contact Links** : For collaboration inquiries, feedback, or just a casual hello, you can find dedicated links to get in touch with me. Always open to connecting with fellow enthusiasts!

## Design Philosophy

* **One-Pager** : Ensuring that you get a holistic view without the need to navigate through different pages. Projects are an exception to this, because it makes sense to keep them separated.
* **Clean Layout** : A clutter-free design that puts emphasis on content, making it easy for visitors to engage and understand.
* **Responsive Design** : Built to look great and function seamlessly across devices of all sizes. Maybe some sections are currently "work in progress".

## Technologies Used

The website is built using modern web technologies ensuring a smooth experience. Here's a quick overview of the tech stack:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* JQuery

## How to Navigate

Since the website is a single-page layout:

* **Top Navigation Bar** : Easily jump to different sections of the page.
* **Scroll** : Simply scroll down to take a journey through my professional life.
