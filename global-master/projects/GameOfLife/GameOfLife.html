                Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by John Conway in 1970. 
                It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, 
                requiring no further input from humans.

                <br>Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation. <br>
                2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. <br>
                3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
                4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
